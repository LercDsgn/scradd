## About

Scradd is the Discord bot for the [Scratch Addons Discord server](https://discord.gg/Cs25kzs889). It was partially made because servers' one year anniversary, and partially because we wanted a bot that we had ultimate customization over.

Potatoboard can be used to higlight messages that the community finds noteworthy: like a good drawing, a good meme in #memes... or a message funny out of context like this:
